The ViewQuestion answers are as Follows

# Creating the ItemView view:

CREATE VIEW ItemView AS
SELECT
i.iId AS iId,
i.Iname AS ItemName,
SUM(oi.Icount) AS NoOfBoxes,
i.Sprice AS ItemPrice,
SUM(oi.Icount) \* i.Sprice AS ItemRevenue,
COUNT(DISTINCT o.cId) AS ItemCustomers
FROM
item i
JOIN
order_item oi ON i.iId = oi.iId
JOIN
`order` o ON oi.oId = o.oId AND oi.sId = o.sId
JOIN
store s ON o.sId = s.sId
WHERE
s.Sname LIKE 'Arlington Sprouts%'
GROUP BY
i.iId;

# Items costing more than $3.00 and bought by customers:

SELECT
iId AS id,
ItemName,
NoOfBoxes,
ItemPrice
FROM
ItemView
WHERE
ItemPrice > 3
AND ItemCustomers > 0;

# Item(s) that generated the minimum revenue:

SELECT
ItemName,
ItemRevenue AS MinItemRevenue
FROM
ItemView
WHERE
ItemRevenue = (SELECT MIN(ItemRevenue) FROM ItemView);

# Min, max, and average revenue for all items in ItemView:

SELECT
MIN(ItemRevenue) AS MinItemRevenue,
MAX(ItemRevenue) AS MaxItemRevenue,
AVG(ItemRevenue) AS AvgItemRevenue
FROM
ItemView;

# Item name and number of customers who bought it, sorted by number of customers in descending order and item names in ascending order:

SELECT
ItemName,
ItemCustomers
FROM
ItemView
ORDER BY
ItemCustomers DESC,
ItemName ASC;

# Total revenue earned, total number of boxes sold, and average revenue per box sold by Arlington Sprouts:

SELECT
SUM(ItemRevenue) AS TotalRevenue,
SUM(NoOfBoxes) AS TotalNoOfBoxes,
SUM(ItemRevenue) / SUM(NoOfBoxes) AS AvgRvenueBox
FROM
ItemView;

# Explanation

# Views -

The above text represents SQL Queries to create the views Requested

# The Procedure

the ItemView view is created using a SQL CREATE VIEW statement. The view combines data from multiple tables in your database to provide a specific set of columns that you can use in other queries as if it were a table. Think of it as a virtual Db table .The purpose of this view is to display item sales information and customer data for the Arlington Sprouts stores.

--The CREATE VIEW statement to define a new view named ItemView.
--The SELECT statement to define the columns that will be part of the view.
--Table aliases are used to make the query more readable. For example,the alias i for the item table, oi for the order_item table, o for the order table, and s for the store table.
--select and alias columns from the tables:

i.iId as iId: Item ID
i.Iname as ItemName: Item name
SUM(oi.Icount) as NoOfBoxes: The number of boxes of the item sold (aggregated using the SUM function)
i.Sprice as ItemPrice: The item price
SUM(oi.Icount) \* i.Sprice as ItemRevenue: The revenue generated by each item (number of boxes sold multiplied by the item price)
COUNT(DISTINCT o.cId) as ItemCustomers: The number of unique customers who bought the item at any of the Arlington Sprouts stores (aggregated using the COUNT function)

--The JOIN clauses are used to establish relationships between the tables:

The item table is joined with the order_item table on i.iId = oi.iId
The order_item table is joined with the order table on oi.oId = o.oId and oi.sId = o.sId
The order table is joined with the store table on o.sId = s.sId

--A WHERE clause has been added to filter the results only for the Arlington Sprouts stores, using the condition s.Sname LIKE 'Arlington Sprouts%'. This ensures that we only retrieve sales data for these specific stores.

--Finally, I use the GROUP BY clause to group the results by i.iId (Item ID), ensuring that we have a separate record for each unique item in the view.
